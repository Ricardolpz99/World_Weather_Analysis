## Overview of Project
PlanMyTrip is a travel planning application, currently users are Beta testers. I was commissioned to add a description of the weather. Beta testers were then given the opportunity to select their weather preferences for their desired destination.
## Results
Destinations that had temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius were searched for, users were shown a map showing all the hotels with the selected temperatures as seen in the first image
